# Session Notes - 2025-12-31

## What We Accomplished

### Project Setup Complete (Phase 0)
- Created complete project structure with microservices architecture
- Set up all configuration files (Makefile, docker-compose.yml, requirements.txt)
- Updated CLAUDE.md from old PCP project to new JobMatch platform

### Web Application (webapp/)
- FastAPI application with SQLAlchemy models
- Database models: Candidate, Company, Job, Application, Skill, Interaction
- Pydantic schemas for request/response validation
- CRUD routers for all entities
- Basic Jinja2 template for homepage
- SQLite database initialized and seeded with sample data

### Service Gateway (gateway/)
- Hot-reload configuration system
- Routing logic with timeout and fallback support
- Baseline implementations for all 6 ML services
- Metrics collection for dashboard

### Baseline ML Services (services/)
- Job Recommender (most recent jobs)
- Salary Predictor (lookup table averages)
- Candidate Ranker (FIFO ordering)
- Resume Parser (keyword matching)
- Demand Forecaster (flat projection)
- Candidate Segmenter (category grouping)

### Dashboard (dashboard/)
- Real-time monitoring interface
- Service health panel
- Gateway metrics display
- Auto-refresh every 5 seconds

### Scripts
- init_db.py - Database initialization
- seed_data.py - Sample data seeding
- smoke_test.py - End-to-end testing

## Decisions Made

1. **SQLite instead of PostgreSQL** - Simpler setup for educational context
2. **Jinja2 templates for MVP** - React can be added later if needed
3. **No bot simulation initially** - Data-related features deferred
4. **Single config file for students** - `config/services.yaml` is the only file students edit

## What's Next

1. **Test the full stack** - Run all services and verify integration
2. **Add more templates** - Job listing, candidate dashboard, recruiter views
3. **Enhance baseline services** - Make them slightly smarter (still rule-based)
4. **Add authentication** - Simple session-based auth for MVP
5. **Create Dockerfiles** - For production deployment

## How to Run

```bash
# Install dependencies
py -m pip install -r requirements.txt

# Initialize database
py scripts/init_db.py

# Seed sample data
py scripts/seed_data.py

# Start webapp (terminal 1)
py -m uvicorn webapp.app.main:app --port 8000 --reload

# Start gateway (terminal 2)
py -m uvicorn gateway.app.main:app --port 8001 --reload

# Start dashboard (terminal 3)
py -m uvicorn dashboard.app.main:app --port 8002 --reload
```

## Open Questions

- Should we add a simple authentication system now or later?
- Do we need more seed data variety?
- Should baseline services query the actual database?
